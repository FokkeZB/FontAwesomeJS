# FontAwesomeJS
Generates a CommonJS module exposing the UniCode strings for all [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) [icons](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/).

## Get it online
An online automagically up-to-date version of the script runs at:

* [http://fa.fokkezb.nl](http://fa.fokkezb.nl)

## Use it in a Titanium app
The module is a standard CommonJS module, but if you want to use it in [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium) apps like I do, this is how to do it:

1. Save [FontAwesome.otf](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/fonts/FontAwesome.otf?raw=true) to `app/assets/fonts` for [Alloy](http://www.appcelerator.com/alloy) or `Resources/fonts` for classic apps.
1. Save [http://fa.fokkezb.nl](http://fa.fokkezb.nl) to `app/lib/fa.js` or `Resources`.
2. Require it where you need it:
    ```javascript
    var fa = require('fa');
    ```
    Or store it as a global, which in Alloy you would do in `app/alloy.js` as:
    ```javascript
    Alloy.Globals.fa = require('fa');
    ```
3. Use the properties together with `FontAwesome` as `fontFamily`, e.g.:
    ```javascript
    '.myLabel': {
        font: {
            fontFamily: 'FontAwesome'
        },
        text: Alloy.Globals.fa.volumeUp
    }
    ```
    
**Note:** This works for `Ti.UI.Label` and `Ti.UI.Button`, except when the button is placed in a toolbar.

## How it works
The scripts reads and parses the [variables.less](https://raw.github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/master/less/variables.less) file straight from the Font Awesome GitHub repository. It does the necessary conversion of the unicode and makes sure icon names like `volume-up` also have a second object-property-friendly version, which for this one would be `volumeUp`. The script caches the resulting file for 3 hours, so whenever Font Awesome adds more fonts, you'll have an up-to-date file shortly after.

## Ideas

* Generate a ZIP containing the module, up-to-date font and an example `app.js`.
